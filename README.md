<h1>👋 Hi, I'm PHxii!</h1> 
<b>I'm a Unity C# Programmer with at least 2 years of serious experince with the engine</b>

<h2>👨‍💻 Sample Projects:</h2> 

- <b>2D Slingshot type movement and guiding system</b>
  - [Aim guiding system](https://github.com/PHxii256/Aim-Guide)
- <b>Dynamic 2D Loop / Area generation system</b>
  - [2D-Loop](https://github.com/PHxii256/2D-Loop)

<b>Other stuff i've worked on: </b> Rythem note timing tool based on a specifc song (like osu! or Guitar Heroes), Human-like aiming inaccuracy generator script for ranged enemies, enemy movement, 3D player controller, scalable Ability / Skills system (like in overwatch or leauge of legends), Inventroy system and items like weapons and resources and equipable items (like in Minecraft), Missions/Quests system with a compass/needle if needed to guide the player on where they need to go, local saving and loading of game data, health and xp systems, skill tree system, enemy spawner script and a lot more I probably forgot to mention, also implementation of UI for a lot of the previously mentioned systems although leaning more on the functional side with placeholder graphics since I never really had the patience or artistic skills to properly add good visuals and stuff. (p.s I can share code snippits for the aforementioned systems if anyone would like to verify or use them but disclaimer they're not well documented hence why I didn't upload them).
